## TNative - Tannus v2.0
#### *Comprehensive toolkit for writing Applications in Haxe 3.2*

The aim of TNative is to provide the tools a developer will need to write applications in Haxe.  Currently, TNative has a focus on non-graphical desktop applications,
but I plan to write a `graphics` package which will at least target JavaScript and Flash in the near future.

### Roadmap:

- Unify FileSystem access across _*all*_ relevant targets
- Unify Network access across _*all*_ relevant targets
